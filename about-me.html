			About Me

		<hr>

			&emsp;I'm a junior at the University of Central Florida studying Computer Science.<br>
			I'm currently an intern at Siemens Energy open to internship opportunities for winter
			and summer 2018. In the past, I have interned at Lockheed Martin on the JASSM cruise missile 
			and worked on a UCF PhD student's project, AnalyticalInk. Outside of classes, I have picked up the 
			topics of data analysis, machine learning, mobile development, and general data structures and algorithms. 
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe I have a passion for learning that few can boast.

			&emsp;All of my work so far has been based in Orlando, Florida. Despite this fact, I'm open to 
			all options that are based in the United States. I'm particularly looking for opportunities that 
			would allow me to learn from and contribute to a team's operations in a meaningful way.<br>
