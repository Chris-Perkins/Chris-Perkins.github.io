			&emsp;I'm a college student at the University of Central Florida studying Computer Science.
			I've challenged myself to do 5 Codeforces problems every Monday through Thursday to
			enhance my problem-solving skill while also acting as a crash-course into Python. I've also
			started extracurricular learning by taking an online course on machine learning.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe I have a passion for learning that few can boast.<br>
			<br>
			Before the end of the year, I plan to do the following:<br>

			&emsp;All of my work so far has been based in Orlando, Florida. Despite this fact, I'm open to 
			all options that are based in the United States. I'm particularly looking for opportunities that 
			would allow me to learn from and contribute to a team's operations in a meaningful way.<br>

			My promise to you and to myself:<br>
			<i>Give me your faith once, and I will give you a reason to give me faith all times afterward.</i>
