			About Me
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Because I do not have any online presence on social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter, 
			I figured you may want to learn more about me rather than just my resume.<br>
			<br>
			I'm a college student at the University of Central Florida studying Computer Science, 
			and I specifically have a passion for learning new environments or working in a fast-paced 
			environment. Over the past year, I've challenged myself to do 5 Codeforces problems every 
			Monday through Thursday in order to grow my problem-solving skill while acting a crash-course 
			into Python.
			<br>
			I believe I have a passion for learning and growing that few can boast, but this passion 
			has just recently been brought out in me.<br>
			<br>
			Before the end of the year, I plan to do the following: (✔️ = done, * = Pending)
			</p>
			
			<div id = "olCustom">
				<p style="text-align:left">
					✔️ Learn Python<br>
					✔️ Learn about native and hybrid mobile application development<br>
					* Learn how to use SalesForce<br>
					* Complete 800 Codeforces problems *300/800*<br>
					* Complete the Stanford Machine Learning Course *pending*<br>
					* Complete the Google FooBar challenge *pending*<br>
