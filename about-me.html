			About Me
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p style = "text-align:left">
			&emsp;Because I do not have any online presence on social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter, 
			I figured you may want to learn about me more than what's on my resume.<br>
			<br>
			&emsp;I'm a college student at the University of Central Florida studying Computer Science.
			I've challenged myself to do 5 Codeforces problems every Monday through Thursday to
			enhance my problem-solving skill while acting a crash-course into Python. I've also started
			extracurricular learning by taking Stanford's online lectures on machine learning and
			database management.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe I have a passion for learning that few can boast.<br>
			<br>
			Before the end of the year, I plan to do the following:<br>
			✔️ Done | ⚠️ In Progress | 🔘 Pending

	<div id = "olCustom">
		<p>✔️ Learn Python</p>
		<p>✔️ Learn about native and hybrid mobile application development</p>
		<p>🔘 Learn how to use SalesForce</p>
		<p>⚠️ Complete 800 Codeforces problems *300/800*</p>
		<p>⚠️ Complete the Stanford Machine Learning Course</p>
		<p>🔘 Complete the Google Foobar challenge</p>
		<p>🔘 Finish Stanford's Databases Course</p>

			&emsp;All of my work so far has been based in Orlando, Florida. Despite this fact, I'm open to 
			all options that are based in the United States. I'm particularly looking for opportunities that 
			would allow me to learn from and contribute to a team's operations in a meaningful way.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			My promise to you and to myself:<br>
			<i>Give me your faith once, and I will give you a reason to give me faith all times afterward.</i>
