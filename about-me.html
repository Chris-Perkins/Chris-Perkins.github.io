			About Me
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p style = "text-align:left">
			Because I do not have any online presence on social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter, 
			I figured you may want to learn about me more than what's on my resume.<br>
			<br>
			I'm a college student at the University of Central Florida studying Computer Science, 
			and I specifically have a passion for fast-paced, team-based environments. Over the past
			year, I've challenged myself to do 5 Codeforces problems every Monday through Thursday 
			to enhance my problem-solving skill while acting a crash-course into Python.<br>
			<br>
			I believe I have a passion for learning and growing that few can boast.<br>
			<br>
			Before the end of the year, I plan to do the following: (✔️ = done, 🔘 = Pending)
